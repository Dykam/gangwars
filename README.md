# Gang Wars

Tiny plugin which implements a simple gang wars mechanic, to work together with worldguard.

The plugin allows players to join a gang, and during certain times of the day everyone who is part of a gang can attack
every all other gang members. Kills give the gang power, which they can use to claim mines and farms. This, in turn,
allows the gang to get extra income when other players use those mines and farms.
